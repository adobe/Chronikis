# ![Chronikis](./img/xronikis-logo.jpeg)

Chronikis (kroh-NEE-kees) is a special-purpose language for creating time-series models. It comes with a compiler
`chronikisc` and an R package `chronikis` that contains utilities for calling the compiler as well as estimating and
forecasting with the compiled time-series models.

The name "Chronikis" is derived from the phrase **χρονική σειρά** (chronikí seirá), which means "time series" in Greek.
 
You can download Chronikis from the [repository](https://github.com/adobe/Chronikis). Here is the manual for [Chronikis 0.2](./chronikis-manual-0.2.pdf).
